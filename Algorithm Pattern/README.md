#Algorithm Pattern #1 : Sliding Window
##In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList), we are asked to find or calculate something among all the subarrays (or sublists) of a given size.

##Main Idea:
###Slide the window by removing the element from the left and adding element to the right
###This will reduce the time complexity to O(n)
