# Algorithm Pattern #2 : Two Pointers
## In problems where we deal with sorted arrays (or LinkedLists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints, the Two Pointers approach becomes quite useful. The set of elements could be a pair, a triplet or even a subarray. 

## Main Idea:
### Move the two pointers until it fulfills the condition
### This will reduce the time complexity to O(n)
